      <description>I have been using the phusion baseimage-docker. While in the past i&amp;rsquo;ve been mostly interested in making my docker images as small as possible with images like alpine-linux(busy-box based) the Phusion base breaks from this tradition by encouraging you to run multiple processes from a single container.
While I was wary of this approach initially they make a good argument for it and in practice I have been really enjoying working in this fashion.</description>
